# just-bot-shower-thoughts

this is the code for my tumblr "bot"
it's a script that creates and generates posts by using the same sentence structures but putting different words in the gaps

# set up

you'll need to add your own tokens if you want to use this as a tumblr bot (with a few modifications of course)
tumblr's api website has some code you can copy and paste

# stuff to work on
I'm currently looking at trying to make the posts more gramatically correct
